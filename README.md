# FlipperPlus
Hypixel Skyblock Bin Flipping Mod

What is Flipper+?

Flipper+ is an elite Hypixel Skyblock flipping mod developed by myself and a couple of friends.
At first we were a little worried about giving it out because we didn't want people abusing it as bad as Not Enough Coins.
Currently, Flipper+ is much faster than all the other flipping mods out there, bringing myself about 3-4b per week.
THIS MOD IS NOT BANNABLE
For any of you asking, no this mod is not bannable because we do not use the auto-buy feature which allows you to instantly buy auctions.
As of right now, the versions of Flipper+ that we have released to the public are slightly nerfed in order for us, the developers to be able to even use the mod.
The current versions that we have released have a 25 second (recently buffed to 15 second) API refresh cooldown, meaning you can look for new flips every 15 seconds. 
Our developer-exclusive versions of the mod allow us to refresh the API whenever we choose to, meaning that we will always get flip priority. 
Don't worry, most of us have our own busy lives, so most of the time, we will not be actively sniping for profits.
Flipper+ is currently the fastest flipping mod on the market meaning that you will always get the best flips and snipes.
